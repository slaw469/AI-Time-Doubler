AI Time Doubler Extension Icons

You need to create the following icon files in the extension/icons/ directory:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use a clock or timer symbol
- Include productivity/focus elements (brain, lightning bolt, etc.)
- Use the brand colors from your app (purple gradient)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

You can use tools like:
- Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Sketch for vector design
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators like DALL-E or Midjourney

For now, you can use placeholder icons or even simple colored squares to test the extension functionality.

Alternative: Use favicon.ico from your web app as a temporary solution.
