AI Time Doubler Extension Icons

âœ… EXTENSION NOW LOADS WITHOUT ICONS
The manifest.json has been temporarily updated to remove icon references so the extension loads properly.

ðŸŽ¨ TO ADD ICONS LATER:

1. Create these files in the extension/icons/ directory:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

2. Add this to manifest.json in the "action" section:
   "default_icon": {
     "16": "icons/icon16.png",
     "32": "icons/icon32.png",
     "48": "icons/icon48.png",
     "128": "icons/icon128.png"
   }

3. Add this as a top-level property in manifest.json:
   "icons": {
     "16": "icons/icon16.png",
     "32": "icons/icon32.png",
     "48": "icons/icon48.png",
     "128": "icons/icon128.png"
   }

Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use a clock or timer symbol
- Include productivity/focus elements (brain, lightning bolt, etc.)
- Use the brand colors from your app (purple gradient)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

You can use tools like:
- Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Sketch for vector design
- Online icon generators like favicon.io
- AI image generators like DALL-E or Midjourney
- Convert your existing favicon to different sizes

For now, the extension will use Chrome's default puzzle piece icon.
